SINR CALCULATION ANALYSIS FOR HANDOFF ALGORITHM IN FEMTOCELL AND MACROCELL NETWORKS
   -  INPUTS TAKEN:
m0  = current Macrocell in which operation takes place
f0  = current femtocell
N = noise power
N = N0B
B is the bandwidth
N0 = -174 dBm/Hz (constant value)
RSPm0 = Received signal power for current Macocell
RSPf0 = Received signal power for current Femtocell
-MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS FOR INDIVIDUAL SINR’S:
SINRm = RSPm0/(N + ∑RSPm + ∑RSPf)
SINRf = RSPf0/(N + ∑RSPf + ∑RSPm)
CRITERION FOR SINR:
Macrocell to Femtocell handoff:
SINRf  > SINRm
-ANALYSIS OF SINR (AFTER HAND IN) FOR FEMTOCELL USERS IN MACRO-FEMTO LTE NETWORKS:
SINR(after hand in) = P/(I + N)
P : Received power that represents ratio between transmitted power of senders s(ψs) 
PLs,r :path loss between sender and receiver
P = ψs/(PLs,r)
I : The interference power of other simultaneous transmissions that use same resources as senders
N: Noise power,for LTE networks it is a constant value of -121.45dBm


-Frequency of occurrence:
The frequency of occurrence comes into picture when the database is full.When a Handoff is requested by the user, a location finger-print is sent along with the measurement report.
The database is then checked for matches.
Nd = Number of similar entries
ds = size of the database
Pfoc = frequency of occurrence
Pfoc = Nd/ds
-A high value of Pfoc implies that it is a zone of frequent handoff.
-Pfoc  and HMad are inversely proportional to each other.
The Ad-Hoc hysteresis margin effect can be expressed as:
HMad  = (1 - Pfoc) HMmax 
HMmax  = optimized value of hysteresis margin
For Macrocell MME (Mobility Management entity) checks the database to find matches and Femto gateway checks in case of femtocell.
