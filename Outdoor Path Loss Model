Option we had= 
1.	Okumura model.      
2.	Hata model.
3.	Cost 231 model. 
4.	UMI model.  
We Choose Hata model, well it doesn’t go beyond 1500MHz but it is available for urban/small or medium sized city/large cities. 
It does not provide coverage to the whole range of frequencies covered by okumura model, but it is suited for both point and broadcast communication, and 
it is flexible as well.  
Equations = 
Hata Model path loss equations =  
L50 (Urban) (db) = 69.55 + 26.16 log 10 fc -13.82 log 10 (hb) – a (hm) + (44.9 – 6.55 log 10 hb) log10 d 
For small or medium sized city = 
Mobile antenna correlation factor = 
A (hm) =(1.1log10 fc – 0.7)hm –(1.56 log10 fc – 0.8)dB 
 For large city(dense urban) = 
a (hm) = 3.2 (log10 11.75 hm)2 – 4.97 db      for fc > 300MHz 
a (hm) = 8.29 (log10 1.54 hm)2 – 1.1 dB       for fc < 300 MHz 
where, 
fc = Carrier frequency (MHz) 
hb = Base station antenna height (In m) 
hm = mobile antenna height (m) 
d = Base station to mobile distance 
a(hm) = correlation factor 
 Input  
1.	Type of city. 
2.	Height of transmitting antenna. 
3.	Height of receiving antenna. 
4.	Frequency.
