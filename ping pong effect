Networks in reality, experience a variation in the power of the signal received. This is due to rapid fading of signals and other associated environmental alterations. 
These variations do not correspond with any recognized pattern involving movement of a particular UE. 
Hence, the nature of UE movement and the fluctuation of signal strength over time could lead to repeated handovers between two neighbouring cells in short time span. 
This repeated and sometimes unnecessary handovers is referred to as Ping-Pong handover (PPH).
In the area where margin is not properly defined for hysteresis between the potential serving cells, ping pong handover occurs. 
In this zones during ping pong HO traffic will shift forwards and backwards between 2 or more cells until settling on to intended candidate cell.
In this type of ping pong HO, mobile will usually carry out 5 handovers in each direction before it settles on new cell. 

This results into increase of signal loading by factor of 5. Hence potential for dropped calls will increase and quality degradation will also increase.
HPP ratio = no. of ping-pong HO/ no. of total HO
