RSSI = 
Received signal strength indicator 
•	Macro – Femto Handoff : To offload traffic from macrocell network in order to avoid network congestion. 
•	Femto – Macro Handoff : To provide seamless mobility management and better QOS while the indoor signal is poor and the macrocell network is not congested. 
•	Wheather we need to handover or not is decided by using RSSI values 

Macro – to – Femto 
If RSSIf > Tn or RSSSm < RSSI min and RSSIf >RSSIm + hmmax then 
Handoff to femto cell 
Else: 
Stay in macrocell. 
End: 
Femto to macro Ho decision. 
   If RSSIf < Tn or RSSSm > RSSI min and RSSIf  + Hmmax < Th then 
Ho to macrocell  
Else 
Stay in Femto cell 
End 
RSSIm  : Received signal strength indicator for macrocell. 
RSSIf  : Received signal strength indicator for fem to cell 
RSSI min : Received signal strength indicator for min macrocell 
Th : Threshold for femtocell. 
Hmmax  : Optimized value of hysteresis margin. 
MME : Mobility management entity. 
FGW : Femto gateway.
PCI : Physical cell entity.
