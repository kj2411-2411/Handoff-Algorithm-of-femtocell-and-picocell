Network throughput refers to how much data can be transferred from source to destination within a given timeframe. 
Throughput measures how many packets arrive at their destinations successfully. 
For the most part, throughput capacity is measured in bits per second, but it can also be measured in data per second. 

The throughput of the MiBS is calculated as, 
Tmicro = ∑j ∑n pmi,j,n Cmi,j,n 
where pmi,j,n is the probability of assigning a subcarrier n to a MiBS user j and Cmi,j,n is the capacity of a MiBS user j on the subcarrier n.


The throughput of the FBS is calculated as,
Tfemto = ∑j∑n pf,j,n Cf,j,n
where pf,j,n is the probability of assigning a subcarrier n to a FBS user j and Cf,j,n is the capacity of a FBS user j on the subcarrier n. 


The throughput of the microcell-femtocell network is given as,
 Tmicro-femto = p1*Tmicro + p2*Tfemto 
Where p1 and p2 are the probabilities of using MiBS and FBS, respectively.
