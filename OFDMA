OFDMA allows multiple clients to transmit or receive from an Access Point at the same time by sharing available bandwidth. 
OFDMA’s spectral efficiency improves transmission latency or delay in RF environment, which has moderate to high congestion level. 
Additionally, it will also increase throughput in certain Wi-Fi 6 deployments due to reduction in collisions and contention time.
Network congestion caused by simultaneous requests causes slowdowns, since clients must form a queue to complete transmissions. 
OFDMA solves the congestion problem by accommodating multiple users at the same time and allocating bandwidth more efficiently.
One way to understand OFDMA is to use delivery trucks as an analogy.
With Wi-Fi 5, each "truck" could carry only a single user's cargo. But with Wi-Fi 6 and OFDMA, the truck can be loaded with multiple users' cargo loads.
Also, its drop-off schedule can be optimized for speed and efficiency.
OFDMA divides a Wi-Fi channel into smaller frequency allocations, called resource units (RUs). 
An access point can communicate with multiple clients by assigning them to specific RUs.
Wi-Fi 5 divides channels into 64 312.5-kHz subcarriers, all of which are used to transmit data to a single client. 
By spacing these carriers orthogonally, OFDMA allows Wi-Fi 6 to divide channels into smaller units without interference.
The number of RUs assigned to each client is determined by factors such as device constraints, quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, and packet size.
The flexibility in scheduling along with the parallel nature of OFDMA increases the productive Air Time efficiency.
